Establishing Expectations for Conflict Engagement

### Timely Conflict Addressing

Set expectations for timely conflict addressing. Encourage individuals to bring up conflicts promptly rather than allowing them to fester and escalate. Emphasize that early intervention leads to more effective resolutions.

### Collaboration and Win-Win Solutions

Promote collaboration and the pursuit of win-win solutions as key expectations for conflict engagement. Encourage individuals to approach conflicts with a mindset focused on finding mutually beneficial outcomes, rather than pursuing personal victories.

Creating Supportive Structures for Conflict Resolution

Evaluation and Continuous Improvement
